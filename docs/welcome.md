# Frontend to Fullstack: A Serverless Workshop

## Welcome

This workshop is designed to help you expand your skillset beyond frontend know-how to fullstack serverless development with AWS. Together we will create the next greatest note-taking app. We will create a REST API with Amazon API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB. After creating the API, we will connect our frontend hosted on S3 to our serverless backend. Allong the way we try to identify best practices and antipatterns.

Let's get started! ðŸ¤©

## Architecture Diagram

The API enables us to create the next awesome notes app. With two routes in place, we can create a new note and list all notes. For both routes, we call Lambda functions and persist our data in a DynamoDB table.
